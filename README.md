# Chinese Language Training app

The idea of this app is to build a webservice with Ruby on Rails which acts as a vocabulary bank.
I want to be able to read through Chinese language pages and using a Chrome Extension to filter out words I do not know.

These words are added to lists which I will then use to train.

Project is a work in progress to teach me how to use rails with Heroku. I had deployed to heroku but
my free time was over so it is not deployed at the moment.
